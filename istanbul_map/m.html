Sirkeci Terminal, along with Haydarpaşa Terminal on the other side of the Bosphorus, are Istanbul's two intercity and commuter railway terminals. Built in 1890 by the Oriental Railway as the eastern terminus of the world-famous Orient Express, Sirkeci Terminal has become a symbol of the city. As of 19 March 2013 service to the station had been indefinitely suspended due to the rehabilitation of the existing line between Kazlıçeşme and Halkalı for the new Marmaray commuter rail line. On 29 October 2013, a new underground station opened to the public and is currently serviced by Marmaray trains travelling across the Bosphorus. Sirkeci Terminal has a total of 4 platforms (3 above, 1 underground) with 7 tracks (5 above, 2 underground). Formerly, commuter trains to Halkalı would depart from tracks 2, 3 and 4 while regional trains to Kapıkule, Edirne and Uzunköprü along with international trains to Bucharest, Sofia and Belgrade would depart from tracks 1 and 5.\n","<br><img src = \"input/my_photos/St Georges Cathedral in Istanbul.jpg\"><br><b><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George%27s_Cathedral,_Istanbul'target='_blank'>St Georges Cathedral in Istanbul<\/a><\/b><br>The Church of St. George (Greek: Καθεδρικός ναός του Αγίου Γεωργίου; Turkish: Aya Yorgi Kilisesi) is the principal Greek Orthodox cathedral still in use in Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey and, as Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire until 1453. \n","<br><img src = \"input/my_photos/Suleymaniye Mosque.jpg\"><br><b><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Süleymaniye_Mosque'target='_blank'>Suleymaniye Mosque<\/a><\/b><br>The Süleymaniye Mosque (Turkish: Süleymaniye Camii, Turkish pronunciation: [sylejˈmaːnije]) is an Ottoman imperial mosque located on the Third Hill of Istanbul, Turkey.
