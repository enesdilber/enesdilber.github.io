    <p>The Mihrimah Sultan Mosque is a 16th-century Ottoman mosque located in the Edirnekapı neighborhood near the Byzantine land walls of Istanbul, Turkey. It was commissioned by Mihrimah Sultan, the daughter of Suleiman the Magnificent and designed by the chief imperial architect Mimar Sinan. Sited on the peak of the Sixth Hill near the highest point of the city, the mosque is a prominent landmark in Istanbul</p>

    <p>Just inside the Edirne Gate to the south stands the magnificent mosque of Mihrimah Sultan, which dominates the Sixth Hill and can be seen for miles about in all directions. It is one of the architectural masterpieces of the great Sinan, built by him for the Princess Mihrimah, the favourite daughter of Süleyman the Magnificent. The külliye was built between 1562 and 1565 and includes, besides the mosque, a medrese, a mektep, a türbe, a double hamam, and a long row of shops in the substructure of the terrace on which it is built. Unfortunately the complex has been very severely damaged by earthquakes at least twice, in 1766 and 1894. Each time the mosque itself was restored but the attendant buildings were for the most part neglected; in recent years some not altogether satisfactory reconstruction has been carried out.</p>

    <p>We enter from the main street through a gate giving access to a short flight of steps leading up to the terrace. On the right is the great courtyard, around three sides of which are the porticoes and cells of the medrese. The west side, which stands just opposite the Theodosian walls with only a narrow road between, has only had its portico restored, and it is difficult to be sure how many cells there were along this side and whether the dershane stood here as one might expect. In the centre of the courtyard is an attractive şadırvan. The mosque is preceded by an imposing porch of seven domed bays supported by eight marble and granite columns. This porch was originally preceded by another, doubtless with a sloping wooden roof supported on 12 columns, traces of which may be seen on the ground. This double porch was a favourite device of Sinan’s, found again at Mihrimah’s other mosque at Üsküdar and in many others.</p>

    <p>The central area of the interior is square, covered by a great dome 20 metres in diameter and 37 metres high under the crown, resting on smooth pendentives. The tympana of all four dome arches are filled with three rows of windows. To north and south high triple arcades, each supported on two great granite columns, open into side aisles with galleries above, each of three domed bays; but these galleries reach only to the springing of the dome arches. The plan thus gives a sense of enormous space and light. Altogether Mihrimah Camii is one of the very finest mosques in the city and must be counted as one of Sinan’s masterpieces. It is curious that this mosque, although imperial, has but one minaret, while Mihrimah’s other mosque in Üsküdar has two.</p>

    <p>The interior stencil decoration is modern, insipid in colour and characterless in design. The mimber, however, is a fine original work of white marble with a beautiful medallion perforated like an iron grille. The voussoirs of the gallery arches are fretted polychrome of verd antique and Proconnesian marble.</p>

    From the exterior the building is strong and dominant as befits its position at the highest point of the city. The square of the dome base with its multi-windowed tympana, identical on all sides, is given solidity and boldness by the four great, weight-towers at the corners, prolongations of the piers that support the dome arches. Above this square rises the dome itself on a circular drum pierced by windows.</p>

    <p>If we walk around to the south side of the mosque, we find a small graveyard at the end of which stands an unusually large sibyan mektebi with a central dome flanked by two cradle-vaults. Beyond this and entered through it is the türbe of the Grand Vezir Güzelce Ahmet Paşa, Mihrimah’s son-in-law. (Mihrimah herself is buried in her fathers türbe at the Süleymaniye.) Ahmet Paşa’s türbe is like only one other built by Sinan, that of Pertev Paşa at Eyüp. It is rectangular, more than twice as long as it is wide, covered by a large dome and two cradle-vaults. A third example of a classical türbe of this form is that of Destari Mustafa Paşa at the Şehzade. Ahmet Paşa’s türbe contains a large number of sarcophagi of members of the family of Princess Mihrimah, many of them children.</p>

    <p>On the north-east side of the mosque, entered from the main street, we see the double hamam of the foundation which has recently been restored. There is nothing unusual about the plan of this hamam: the eyvans of the hararet have semidomes, the hücre domes are on simple pendentives, and the entrance is, as often, off-centre through one of the hücres. At the corner of the hamam is a simple but attractive çeşme.</p>
